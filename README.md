# talentail

Problem statement: Designers and developers have portfolio websites like Behance, Dribbble and GitHub in order to showcase their capabilities. However, there isn't really a similar type of website/platform for business analysts to showcase their capabilities of developing/solving business cases.

Solution: Talentail was developed to house business cases from real world consulting use cases for business analysts to attempt.
